# StartTheBotAlready
 
Bot that outputs the appropriate AoE2 taunt into a voice channel when a user types a number from 1 - 42 by itself.

Bit of a hacky toy. No guarantees with bugs or whatever.

If you want to host this locally, you'll need to copy the taunt audio files from your AoE2 installation into a folder called "audio", in the same folder as main.py
You'll also need a way of playing the audio files - this is set up for windows - default is ffmpeg.exe, which can be downloaded at https://ffmpeg.org/ and placed into a folder titled ffmpeg.
